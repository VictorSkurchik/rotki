//! The in-process HTTP server + reverse proxy that replaces nginx in the Docker
//! image (Phase 2, Work item 1′).
//!
//! It is the single externally-bound listener: it serves the SPA static bundle
//! and reverse-proxies the dynamic routes to the loopback backends. The route
//! semantics are a faithful port of `packaging/docker/nginx.conf`:
//!
//! | Route        | Upstream                  | Path handling          |
//! |--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
//! | `/api/1/*`   | `core` (127.0.0.1:4242)   | preserved              |
//! | `/ws/*`      | `core` (127.0.0.1:4242)   | preserved + WS upgrade |
//! | `/colibri/*` | `colibri` (127.0.0.1:4343)| prefix **stripped**    |
//! | `/mcp`       | `mcp` (127.0.0.1:4445)    | preserved              |
//! | `/health`    | served here               | supervisor liveness    |
//! | everything   | static SPA on disk        | SPA fallback to index  |
//!
//! Unlike nginx, the proxy **streams** request/response bodies without buffering,
//! so the upload endpoints that needed nginx's per-path 50 MiB bump work without
//! special-casing, a single configurable global ceiling (`max_body_bytes`)
//! guards the proxied API routes instead of nginx's per-`location` list. The
//! static SPA is gzip/brotli-compressed and served with cache + security headers.
